Next Steps:
 While determining the scope of this project I left a couple of TODOs that I felt took away from the purpose of this project. In the future I plan on adding these, but want to make a note of them here.

Error Handling
 - Http error codes I am sending need more work to be sure. Proper analyisis of invalid input and throwing of 400s needs to be added.
